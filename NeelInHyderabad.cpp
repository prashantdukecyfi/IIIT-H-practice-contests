He also wants the flat number to be as small as possible. He's given apartment names and the corresponding flat numbers. Help him with the best option possible by printing the Apartment name. If there's no flat available meeting his requirement print -1.

Input Format

    The first line is an integer N denoting the number of flats
    The next N lines contain the apartment names(a) and the corresponding flat numbers(f)

Constraints

    1 <= N <= 10^5
    1 <= |a| <= 10
    1 <= |f| <= 10^9

Output Format

    Print the apartment name of the best option available to Neel.
    If the criteria doesn't satisy, print -1.
